Hello, I'm Isaac, a recent graduate from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) with a major in Networking, Cybersecurity, and Software Development. Passionate about technology, I enjoy delving into various domains, exploring electronics, and continuously challenging myself to build impactful applications using the skills I've acquired. Now I am already working full-time as a C++/C# programmer, I am still dedicating myself to continuous learning and eager to collaborate with like-minded developers, and also having fun in the process.
